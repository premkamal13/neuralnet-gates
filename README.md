# neuralnet-gates
Using single and multi-layered perceptrons to implement logic operations and then create a automatically learning neural network that back-propagates the errors and learns to improve itself over time

Stages of training the Neural network:

1. Feed a sample to the network
2. Calculate Mean Standard Error
3. Calculate the error term for output neurons
4. Iteratively calculate the error terms in all the hidden layers
5. Apply delta rule to adjust the weights of the neuron with a suitable learning rate
